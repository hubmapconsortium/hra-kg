title: 3D Reference Organ for Brain, Female
description: |-
  [This reference organ](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using data from the "[Allen Human
  Reference Atlas – 3D, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.24080)" representing one half of the human brain (Ding et al.,
  2016). The 141 anatomical structures were mirrored to arrive at a whole human brain (as intended) and resized to fit
  the Visible Human Male and Female bodies.
