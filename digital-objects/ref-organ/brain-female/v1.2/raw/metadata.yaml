title: 3D Reference Organ for Brain, Female
description: >-
  [This reference organ](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created
  using data from the "[Allen Human Reference Atlas – 3D,
  2020](https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.24080)" representing one half of the human
  brain (Ding et al., 2016). The 141 anatomical structures were mirrored to
  arrive at a whole human brain (as intended) and resized to fit the Visible
  Human Male and Female bodies. Note that this organ is not licensed under
