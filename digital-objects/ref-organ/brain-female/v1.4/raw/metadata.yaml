title: 3D Reference Organ for Brain, Female
description: |-
  This reference organ, Brain-female (https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using data from the Allen
  brain reference atlas (Ding et al. 2016). The 141 anatomical structures were mirrored to arrive at a whole human brain
  (as intended) and resized to fit the Visible Human Male and Female bodies (Spitzer et al. 1996; Ackerman 1998; Spitzer
  and Whitlock 2002). In version v1.3, an update in licensing occurred; this brain model is now licensed under Creative
  Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). Ding et al. 2016 was used to inform the creation of this model.
