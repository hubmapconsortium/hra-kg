title: 3D Reference Organ for Pancreas, Female
description: |-
  This reference organ, Pancreas-female (https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using data from the
  Visible Human Dataset, provided by the National Library of Medicine (Spitzer and Whitlock 2002). In version v1.3,
  adjustments were made from the previous version to make the neck region smaller, and the body and tail regions more
  equal in length.
