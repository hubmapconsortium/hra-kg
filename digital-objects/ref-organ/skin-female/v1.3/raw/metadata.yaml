title: 3D Reference Organ for Skin, Female
description: >-
  [This reference organ](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created
  using data from the Visible Human Female, provided by the National Library of
  Medicine.The torso of the skin model was moved up from previous editions to
  incorporate the clavicles and other anatomy for the breast. It was also
  adjusted to add space for the triceps surae and the ankle bones for the
  eventual addition of the triceps surae muscles and landmark organs.
