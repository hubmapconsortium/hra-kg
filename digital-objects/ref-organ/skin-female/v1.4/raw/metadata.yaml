title: 3D Reference Organ for Skin, Female
description: |-
  [This reference organ](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using data from the Visible Human
  Female, provided by the National Library of Medicine.The torso of the skin model was moved up from previous editions
  to incorporate the clavicles and other anatomy for the breast. It was also adjusted to add space for the triceps surae
  and the ankle bones for the eventual addition of the triceps surae muscles and landmark organs.
