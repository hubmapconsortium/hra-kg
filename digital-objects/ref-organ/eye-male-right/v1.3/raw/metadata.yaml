title: 3D Reference Organ for Eye, Male, Right
description: >-
  "This reference organ (https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using data from the Visible Human Male, provided by the National Library of Medicine (Spitzer et al. 1996; Ackerman 1998). In version v1.3, the long posterior ciliary artery was added, as well as a more detailed iris. The position of the optic nerve was also moved and made twice as thick. Muscle thickness was decreased and the positions of the muscles were shifted. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle was removed as it was not deemed necessary to the eye model. The inferior oblique muscle was rotated more parallel to the plane of the cornea.
