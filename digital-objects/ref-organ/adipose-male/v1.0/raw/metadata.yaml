title: 3D reference organ for subcutaneous adipose tissue, Male
description: |-
  [This reference organ](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using data from the Visible Human Dataset, provided by the National Library of Medicine (Spitzer and Whitlock 2002). The current skin model (https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library?version=9&organ=Skin) was sectioned out in places where subcutaneous adipose tissue samples are commonly taken, and thickness was added to the skin.
