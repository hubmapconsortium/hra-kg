title: 3D Reference Organ for Lymph Node, Male
description: >-
  This reference organ (https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using the Clearing-enhanced 3D (Ce3D)
  method developed by Dr. Weizhe Li, Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
  Diseases, NIH using data documented in (Li, Germain, and Gerner 2017). While the size and cellular composition of
  mouse and human lymph nodes varies between species, the overall anatomy is well-conserved.
