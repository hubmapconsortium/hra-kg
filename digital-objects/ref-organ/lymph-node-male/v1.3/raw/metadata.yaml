title: 3D Reference Organ for Lymph Node, Male
description: >-
  [This reference organ](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created
  using the Clearing-enhanced 3D (Ce3D) method developed by Dr. Weizhe Li,
  Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and
  Infectious Diseases, NIH using data documented in
  https://www.pnas.org/content/114/35/E7321. While the size and cellular
  composition of mouse and human lymph nodes varies between species, the overall
  anatomy is well-conserved.
