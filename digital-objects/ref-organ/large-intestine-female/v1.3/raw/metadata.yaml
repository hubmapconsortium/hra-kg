title: 3D Reference Organ for Large Intestine, Female
description: >-
  "This reference organ (https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was not based on direct imaging data, as no suitable source was available at the time. Instead, the female colon model was created by roughly following the general path of the Visible Human Female and fitted around surrounding organs.
