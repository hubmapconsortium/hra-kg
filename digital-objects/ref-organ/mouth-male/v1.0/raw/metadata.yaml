title: 3D Reference Organ for Mouth, Male
description: |-
  This reference organ, Mouth-male (https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using data from the Visible
  Human Male dataset, provided by the National Library of Medicine (Spitzer et al., 1996; Ackerman, 1998). The 3D model
  features anatomically segmented oral structures including the gingiva, lingual mucosa, palate, vestibular tissues,
  teeth, and salivary structures. The segmentation and anatomical validation were informed by standard dental and
  medical references, including *Ten Cate’s Oral Histology*, *Netter’s Head and Neck Anatomy for Dentistry*, *Carranza’s
  Clinical Periodontology*, and *A Colour Atlas and Textbook of Oral Anatomy, Histology and Embryology* by Berkovitz et
  al., enabling consistency across sex-specific models and integration with molecular datasets.
