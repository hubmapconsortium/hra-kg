title: 3D Reference Organ for Mouth, Female
description: >-
  This reference organ (https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using data from the Visible Human Female dataset, provided by the National Library of Medicine (Spitzer and Whitlock, 2002). The model includes high-resolution segmentations of oral anatomical structures such as the gingiva, tongue, hard and soft palate, buccal mucosa, floor of mouth, teeth, and major salivary gland ducts. Its anatomical fidelity is grounded in foundational atlases and textbooks including *Ten Cate’s Oral Histology*, *Netter’s Head and Neck Anatomy for Dentistry*, *Carranza’s Clinical Periodontology*, and *A Colour Atlas and Textbook of Oral Anatomy, Histology and Embryology* by Berkovitz et al. These references guided the modeling of epithelial, connective tissue, vascular, and glandular regions for use in spatial biology research and clinical translation.
