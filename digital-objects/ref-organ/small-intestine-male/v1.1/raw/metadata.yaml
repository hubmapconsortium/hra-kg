title: 3D Reference Organ for Small Intestine, Male
description: >-
  [This reference
  organ](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/ccf-3d-reference-library.html)
  was created using data from the Visible Human Male, provided by the National
  Library of Medicine. The small intestines have been updated to include a
  measurement system. A centerline was made in the center of the intestines, and
  markers placed along the centerline. The teal discs measure 5 cm along the
  intestines, the green dashes measure 1 cm. The yellow disc marks the
  jejunoileal junction. The VHM small intestine total length is 285 cm.
