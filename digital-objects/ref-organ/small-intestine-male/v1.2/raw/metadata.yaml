title: 3D Reference Organ for Small Intestine, Male
description: >-
  This reference organ (https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using data from the Visible Human Male, provided by the National Library of Medicine (Spitzer et al. 1996; Ackerman 1998). The small intestines have been updated to include a measurement system. A centerline was made in the center of the intestines, and markers were placed along the centerline. The teal discs measure 5 cm along the intestines, the green dashes measure 1 cm, and the yellow disc marks the jejunoileal junction. The VHM small intestine total length is 285 cm.
