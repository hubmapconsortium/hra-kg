title: 3D Reference Organ for Lymph Node, Female, Right
description:
  "[This reference organ](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was
  created using the Clearing-enhanced 3D (Ce3D) method developed by Dr. Weizhe Li,
  Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
  Diseases, NIH using data documented in https://www.pnas.org/content/114/35/E7321.
  While the size and cellular composition of mouse and human lymph nodes varies between
  species, the overall anatomy is well-conserved."
