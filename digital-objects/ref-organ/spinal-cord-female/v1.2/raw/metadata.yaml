title: 3D Reference Organ for Spinal Cord, Female
description:
  "[This reference organ](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was
  created using data from the Visible Human Female (VHF), provided by the National
  Library of Medicine. The VHF has 6 lumbar verts, and the total length of her spinal
  column is 60.923 cm. [(Frostell et al. 2016)](https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fneur.2016.00238)
  was referenced during model preparation."
