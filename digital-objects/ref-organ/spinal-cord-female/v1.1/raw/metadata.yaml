title: 3D Reference Organ for Spinal Cord, Female
description: |-
  This reference organ, Spinal-cord-female (https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using data from the
  Visible Human Dataset (VHD), provided by the National Library of Medicine (Spitzer and Whitlock 2002). The Visible
  Human Female has 6 lumbar vertebrae, and the total length of her spinal column is 60.923 cm. Frostell et al. 2016 was
  referenced during model preparation.
