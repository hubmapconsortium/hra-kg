title: 3D Reference Organ for Small Intestine, Female
description: >-
  This reference organ, Small-intestine-female (https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created using data from
  the Visible Human Dataset, provided by the National Library of Medicine (Spitzer and Whitlock 2002). The small
  intestines have been updated to include a measurement system. A centerline was made in the center of the intestines,
  and markers placed along the centerline. The teal discs measure 5 cm along the intestines, the green dashes measure 1
  cm. The yellow disc marks the jejunoileal junction. The Visible Human Female small intestine total length is 200 cm.
