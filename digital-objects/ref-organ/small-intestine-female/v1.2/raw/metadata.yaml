title: 3D Reference Organ for Small Intestine, Female
description: >-
  [This reference organ](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library) was created
  using data from the Visible Human Female, provided by the National Library of
  Medicine. The small intestines have been updated to include a measurement
  system. A centerline was made in the center of the intestines, and markers
  placed along the centerline. The teal discs measure 5 cm along the intestines,
  the green dashes measure 1 cm. The yellow disc marks the jejunoileal junction.
  The VHF small intestine total length is 200 cm.
