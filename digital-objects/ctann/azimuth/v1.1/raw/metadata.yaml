title: Crosswalk of Azimuth annotated cells to Cell Ontology
description: |-
  This crosswalk maps the cell type annotations from Azimuth https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/ to the latest
  revision of Cell Ontology Version IRI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cl/releases/2024-05-15/cl.owl in which many new
  cell types have been added since the original cell type annotations were mapped for Human - PBMC, Human - Pancreas,
  Human - Kidney, and Human - Bone Marrow. New Azimuth references for Human - Lung v2 (HLCA), Human - Adipose, Human -
  Heart, Human - Liver and Human - Tonsil v2 were mapped for the first time in this crosswalk.
