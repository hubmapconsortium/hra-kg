title: SenNet Dataset Graph
description: |-
  This ds-graph represents the information for tissue blocks registered (Börner et al. 2022) for the Cellular Senescence
  Network (SenNet) (SenNet Consortium et al. 2022). It provides sample registration information submitted by consortium
  members in single-cell atlassing efforts, including accurate sample sizes and positions (Bueckle et al. 2025). When
  combined with ref-organ data, this information helps create 3D visual tissue sample placements. Additionally, the
  sample information is linked to datasets from researchers' assay analyses that offer deeper insights into the tissue
  samples. The “ds” stands for “dataset.” ds-graphs represent datasets by tissue sample and donor.
