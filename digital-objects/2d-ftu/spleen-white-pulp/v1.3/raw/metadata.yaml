title: 2D White Pulp Functional Tissue Unit (FTU) for Spleen
description: >-
  This functional tissue unit (FTU) illustration includes cell types related to the white pulp of spleen FTU in the 
  ASCT+B Table Spleen v1.3. Multiple histology atlases, especially “Human Microscopic Anatomy” (R.V. Krstić, 1994) and 
  “Netter’s Essential Histology” (William K. Ovale and Patrick C. Nahirney, 2021) were referenced.

  Note: These illustrations are a stylized representation of the average number and distribution of cell type 
  populations within a functional tissue unit (FTU). Cell types are included based on their linkage to the FTU 
  in each organ’s Anatomical Structures, Cell Type and Biomarkers (ASCT+B) Table. The intention is to illustrate 
  relationships between individual cells and to include visual information on their relative shape, scale and 
  distribution within the tissue. A relationship to blood supply is indicated. We are working towards an understanding 
  of cellular relationships within each FTU, as well as perfusion, innervation, structural and extracellular matrix 
  support. Greater relationships of scale within the body are also considered. Smaller FTUs may be nested within larger 
  FTUs. This work is iterative and will be updated in regular publication cycles. In future releases, illustrations will 
  be linked to data sets interactively. Machine learning and AI are employed in segmenting these FTUs from data which 
  will be connected to the illustrations in future publication cycles.
