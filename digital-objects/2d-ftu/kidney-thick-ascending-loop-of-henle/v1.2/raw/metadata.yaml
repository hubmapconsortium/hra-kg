title: 2D Thick Ascending Limb of Loop of Henle FTU for Kidney
description: >-
  This functional tissue unit (FTU) illustration includes cell types related to the thick ascending limb of loop of
  Henle FTU in the ASCT+B Table [Kidney v1.2] (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM248.CBJV.556). This illustration was inspired
  by the [Kidney Tissue Atlas Explorer] (https://atlas.kpmp.org/explorer) created by the Kidney Precision Medicine
  Project (KPMP). Multiple histology atlases, especially *Human Microscopic Anatomy (Krstić 1994)* and *Histology: A
  Text and Atlas (Ross et al. 2003)* were referenced. Cell type diameters were primarily defined by (Hu, McDonough, and
  Layton 2021). Uberon describes this FTU as follows: "The distal sub-portion of the ascending loop of Henle which is
  lined by simple cuboidal epithelium and enters the renal cortex to empty a hypotonic filtrate into the distal
  convoluted tubule."
