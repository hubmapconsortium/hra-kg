title: 2D Renal Corpuscle Functional Tissue Unit (FTU) for Kidney
description: |-
  This functional tissue unit (FTU) illustration was created from anatomical structures and cell types listed in the
  ASCT+B Table [Kidney v1.1](https://cdn.humanatlas.io/hra-releases/v1.1/asct-b/ASCT-B_VH_Kidney.csv). This illustration
  was inspired and heavily influenced by the [Kidney Tissue Atlas Explorer](https://atlas.kpmp.org/explorer/). Multiple
  histology atlases, especially “Human Microscopic Anatomy” (R.V. Krstić, 1994) and “Histology: A Text and Atlas”
  (Michael H. Ross, et al., 2003) were referenced. Also helpful was “The CIBA Collection of Medical Illustrators: Volume
  6. Kidneys, Ureters, and Urinary Bladder” (Frank H. Netter, 1979.)
