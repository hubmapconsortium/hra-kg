title: 2D Nephron Functional Tissue Unit (FTU) for Kidney
description: >-
  This functional tissue unit (FTU) illustration includes cell types related to
  the nephron FTU in the ASCT+B Table [Kidney
  v1.3](https://cdn.humanatlas.io/hra-releases/v1.4/asct-b/asct-b-vh-kidney.csv).
  This illustration was inspired by the [Kidney Tissue Atlas
  Explorer](https://atlas.kpmp.org/explorer/)created by the Kidney Precision
  Medicine Project (KPMP). Multiple histology atlases, especially “Human
  Microscopic Anatomy” (R.V. Krstić, 1994) and “Histology: A Text and Atlas”
  (Michael H. Ross, et al., 2003) were referenced. Cell type diameters were
  primarily defined by [(Hu, McDonough, and Layton
  2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102667). In v1.2 of the 2D Nephron
  FTU for kidney, three insets were added: inner and outer medullary and
  cortical collecting ducts. Regional areas of the kidney were adjusted to
  reflect the ratio of the stripes against KPMP measurements. Minor revisions
  were also made in v1.2 to fix overlapping labels or labels in different layers
  of the ai file and to correct missing colors in some sections of the
  illustrations to use the svg file in the interactive FTU Explorer.
