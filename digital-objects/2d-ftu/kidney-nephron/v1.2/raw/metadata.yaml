title: 2D Nephron Functional Tissue Unit (FTU) for Kidney
description: |-
  This functional tissue unit (FTU) illustration includes cell types related to the nephron FTU in the ASCT+B Table
  [Kidney v1.4](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM636.MXKP.682). This illustration was inspired by the [Kidney Tissue Atlas
  Explorer](https://atlas.kpmp.org/explorer) created by the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). Multiple histology
  atlases, especially *Human Microscopic Anatomy* (Krstić 1994) and *Histology: A Text and Atlas* (Ross et al. 2003)
  were referenced. Cell type diameters were primarily defined by (Hu, McDonough, and Layton 2021). Uberon describes this
  FTU as follows: "The basic functional unit of the kidney. Its chief function is to regulate the concentration of water
  and soluble substances like sodium salts by filtering the blood, reabsorbing what is needed and excreting the rest as
  urine. A nephron eliminates wastes from the body, regulates blood volume and blood pressure, controls levels of
  electrolytes and metabolites, and regulates blood pH. Its functions are vital to life and are regulated by the
  endocrine system by hormones such as antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone, and parathyroid hormone."
