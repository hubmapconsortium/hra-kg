title: 2D Cortical Collecting Duct FTU for Kidney
description: >-
  This functional tissue unit (FTU) illustration includes cell types related to the cortical collecting duct FTU in the
  ASCT+B Table [Kidney v1.2] (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM248.CBJV.556). This illustration was inspired by the [Kidney
  Tissue Atlas Explorer] (https://atlas.kpmp.org/explorer) created by the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP).
  Multiple histology atlases, especially *Human Microscopic Anatomy (Krstić 1994)* and *Histology: A Text and Atlas
  (Ross et al. 2003)* were referenced. Cell type diameters were primarily defined by (Hu, McDonough, and Layton 2021).
  Uberon describes this FTU as follows: "The cortical collecting duct is the portion of the collecting duct that resides
  in the renal cortex."
