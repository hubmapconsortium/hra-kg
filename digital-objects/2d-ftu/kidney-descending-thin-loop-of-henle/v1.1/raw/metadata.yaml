title: 2D Descending Thin Limb of Loop of Henle FTU for Kidney
description: |-
  This functional tissue unit (FTU) illustration includes cell types related to the descending thin limb of loop of Henle FTU in the ASCT+B Table [Kidney v1.2](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM248.CBJV.556). This illustration was inspired by the [Kidney Tissue Atlas Explorer](https://atlas.kpmp.org/explorer) created by the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). Multiple histology atlases, especially *Human Microscopic Anatomy* (Krstić 1991) and *Histology: A Text and Atlas* (Wojciech Pawlina and Michael H. Ross 2019) were referenced. Cell types and metrics were primarily defined by (Hu, McDonough, and Layton 2021; Layton and Layton 2019). Uberon describes this FTU as follows: "The portion of the renal tubule that constitutes the proximal part of the loop of Henle, has low permeability to ions and urea, and is highly permeable to water; it consists of an initial short thick segment lined by low simple cuboidal epithelium and a long thin segment lined by simple squamous epithelium; however, this distinction is not as important physiologically as in the ascending limb, so often the two are treated as one structure."
