  OMAP-16 Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Lung with CODEX
description: |-
  OMAP-16 was developed for Multiplexed Immunofluorescent (MxIF) imaging of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
  human lung sections using the Akoya Biosciences Phenocycler-Fusion platform (Purkerson, Pryhuber, Colon, et al. 2023).
  This panel includes 34 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. OMAP-16
  provides spatial context for airway, vasculature, and alveolar features, and detects 35 of 72 epithelial, endothelial,
  and immune cell types listed in the ASCT+B Lung v1.2 table (Pryhuber 2021). It does not capture Cap1 and Cap2
  endothelial cells, eosinophils/basophils, fibroblasts/pericytes, neuroendocrine cells, ciliated cells, chondrocytes,
  or NK cells, though antibody barcode conjugates for these are under development. Cell segmentation was performed using
  the StarDist extension in QuPATH 0.3.2, based on DAPI-stained nuclei. Vascular smooth muscle and airway epithelial
  structures were annotated using thresholded ACTA2 and PanCK signals with the Pixel Classifier in QuPATH, with
  resulting object data exported as GeoJSON files. Antigen retrieval was carried out using AR9 Buffer (Akoya
  Biosciences) at 110°C for 20 minutes. Barcode-conjugated antibodies were sourced from Akoya Biosciences or created
  through custom conjugation using their antibody conjugation kit (Cat# 232195). For optimal preservation of structural
  features, antibodies targeting extracellular matrix and vascular smooth muscle should be imaged early (within the
  first five imaging cycles). The antibody validation protocol and full imaging workflow are documented in the
  referenced protocols.
