  OMAP-5 Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP)  for Multiplexed Antibody-Based
  Imaging of Human Liver with SIMS
description: >-
  OMAP-5 was designed for Secondary Ionization Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) imaging
  of fresh frozen human liver samples
  (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.26.508878). The panel contains 20 antibodies
  and a cationic nucleic acid intercalator that contains natural-abundance
  iridium. Antibodies directed against EGFR and Na/K ATPase were used for cell
  segmentation and image alignment. This OMAP provides spatial context for the
  anatomical structures, metabolic zonation, and cell types present in the
  [ASCT+B liver table v1.0](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM476.BQCC.574). This OMAP
  does not yet contain antibodies for NK cells, dendritic cells, portal
  fibroblasts, MAIT cells, gamma delta T cells, and hepatic oval cells. Antigens
  were detected using lanthanide tagged primary antibodies where the metal tags
  were detected by specific mass channels using C60 SIMS. Details on the
  antibody staining method can be found here
  (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.b5qmq5u6). Image registration and cell
  segmentation were performed using Deepcell (Keren et al.) Cell segmentation
  was performed using nuclear and membrane marker channels. Integrated protein
  expression was used to determine thresholds for cellular classification.
