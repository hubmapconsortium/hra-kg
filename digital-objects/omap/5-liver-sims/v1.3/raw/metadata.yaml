  OMAP-5 Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP)  for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Liver with SIMS
description: |-
  OMAP-5 was designed for Secondary Ionization Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) imaging of fresh frozen human liver samples
  (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.26.508878). The panel contains 20 antibodies and a cationic nucleic acid intercalator
  that contains natural-abundance iridium. An antibody directed against Na/K ATPase was used for cell segmentation and
  image alignment. This OMAP provides spatial context for the anatomical structures, metabolic zonation, and cell types
  present in the [ASCT+B liver table v1.0](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM476.BQCC.574). This OMAP does not yet contain
  antibodies for NK cells, dendritic cells, portal fibroblasts, MAIT cells, gamma delta T cells, and hepatic oval cells.
  Antigens were detected using lanthanide tagged primary antibodies where the metal tags were detected by specific mass
  channels using C60 SIMS. Details on the antibody staining method can be found here
  (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.b5qmq5u6). Image registration and cell segmentation were performed using Deepcell
  (Keren et al.) Cell segmentation was performed using nuclear and membrane marker channels. Integrated protein
  expression was used to determine thresholds for cellular classification. An antibody directed against EGFR was
  originally included in OMAP-5 v1.0 and v1.1, but was removed due to inconsistent labeling.
