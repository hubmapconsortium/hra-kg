  OMAP-6  Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Pancreas with CODEX
description: >-
  The OMAP Pancreas panel was designed for CODEX (CO Detection by IndEXing) imaging of Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded
  (FFPE) human pancreas samples. Following antigen retrieval (citrate buffer pH=6, heating at high pressure 114-121°C
  for 20 minutes), tissue autofluorescence was reduced using a photobleaching protocol (Du Z. et al, 2019, modified by
  Derek Oldrige). CODEX is based on DNA-conjugated antibodies allowing the image acquisition of 3 antibodies per cycle
  and removal of complementary fluorescently labeled DNA probes afterwards Goltsev, Y. et al, 2018. Cell junction
  markers (E-cadherin,Beta-catenin) and nuclear marker Hoechst are used for cell segmentation. The resulting OMAP
  contains 12 antibodies and provides a spatial context for most relevant anatomical structures and cell types in the
  pancreas including pancreatic cells (alpha, beta, gamma, delta), ductal cells, endothelial cells,smooth muscle and
  mesenchymal cells present in the ASCT-B pancreas table, v1.0. Acinar and epsilon cells are not targeted in the
  existing panel due to the complexity of finding suitable and stable antibodies. A representative dataset using this
  OMAP can be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/7742474. An antibody directed against pancreatic polypeptide (PPY)
  was originally included in OMAP-5 v1.0 and v1.1, but was removed due to inconsistent labeling.
