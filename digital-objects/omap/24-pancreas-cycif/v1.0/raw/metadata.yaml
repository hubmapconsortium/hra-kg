  OMAP-24: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed  Antibody-Based Imaging
  of Human Pancreas with CyCIF
description: >-
  OMAP-24 was created for the detection of 13 protein biomarkers in the human pancreas
  with a focus on pancreatic ganglia and nervous innervation. We employed a cyclic
  immunofluorescence (CyCIF) staining pipeline on human formalin fixed paraffin embedded
  (FFPE) pancreas samples (fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) instead of 10% formalin).
  Our full staining protocol can be found at (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.261ger4djl47/v1).
  Images from sequential staining rounds were aligned using nuclear markers DAPI (cycle
  1) and Hoechst S769121 (cycles 2 and 3). This OMAP contributes spatial data for
  anatomical structures and cell types listed in ASCT+B pancreas table version 1.3  (https://lod.humanatlas.io/asct-b/pancreas/v1.3/)
  with a focus on pancreatic ganglia and nerves. This OMAP builds on OMAP-6 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM847.DNHP.222)
  and OMAP-13 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM434.SDFF.876) for the human pancreas, adding
  valuable spatial data on nervous innervation in the pancreas. Glial cells, interstitial
  cells, and immune cells are not targeted in this OMAP due to difficulties finding
  appropriate antibodies. This is the first OMAP focused on pancreas nerve innervation
  and pancreatic ganglia, shedding more light on pancreatic diseases including type
  1 diabetes. Tissue sections were prepared according to the Human Pancreas Processing
  protocol found at (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.n2bvj6dnblk5/v1). Our full
  CyCIF staining protocol can be found at (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.261ger4djl47/v1).
  All tissue samples were subjected to antigen retrieval for 25 minutes at 95°C in
  a vegetable steamer using 1X AR9 solution prepared from stock. For primary antibodies  requiring
  TSA amplification, HRP polymer reagents (ImmPRESS HRP Horse anti-Goat IgG  Polymer
  Reagent, Vector Laboratories #30036; ImmPRESS HRP Goat anti-Rat IgG Polymer  Reagent,
  Vector Laboratories #MP-7404-50; 1X Opal Anti-Ms + Rb HRP, Akoya Biosciences  #ARH1001EA)
  were used; see our CyCIF protocol for additional details. To detect the antibodies
  in our OMAP, we used a combination of OPAL TSA fluorophores and Alexa Fluor conjugated
  secondary antibodies. In our tests, we did not find any staining cycle sensitivity
  of specific antibodies. A sample dataset for this OMAP can be found at (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14867745).
