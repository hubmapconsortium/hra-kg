  OMAP-3 Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP)  for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Kidney with CODEX
description: |-
  OMAP-3 was designed for CODEX (CO Detection by IndEXing) of fresh frozen human kidney samples
  (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00556-8, https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.202048891). The panel contains 24 antibodies
  and the nuclear marker DAPI for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. Additional details on tissue preparation,
  panel design, image analysis, and representative images can be found in accompanying publications
  (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2021.08.033, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2021.100747). This OMAP provides a spatial
  context for all anatomical structures and most cell types present in the [ASCT+B kidney table
  v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM673.ZZDK.622). Additionally, the inclusion of tryptase and MARCKS allow profiling of
  different regions in the glomeruli that are often affected by disease. Several cell types are identified by their
  morphology, location in the kidney, and expression of Cytokeratin 7. The panel was designed to provide a survey of the
  cell types found in the kidney and does not allow for granular phenotyping of immune cell populations. However, mast
  cells, NK cells, T cells, and B cells are broadly classified by several markers included in this OMAP. The core and
  essential protein biomarkers detailed here overlap (>40%) with a panel developed for multiplexed imaging of kidney
  samples using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) (10.1172/jci.insight.129477).
