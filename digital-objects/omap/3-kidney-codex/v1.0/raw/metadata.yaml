  Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP)  for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Kidney with CODEX
description: |-
  The OMAP kidney panel was designed for CODEX (CO Detection by IndEXing) of fresh frozen human kidney samples. The
  panel contains 24 antibodies and the nuclear marker Hoechst 33342 or DAPI for image alignment and nuclear
  segmentation. This OMAP provides a spatial context for all anatomical structures and most cell types present in the
  [ASCT+B kidney table v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM673.ZZDK.622). Additionally, the inclusion of protein
  biomarkers tryptase and MARCKS  allow profiling of different regions in glomeruli that are often affected by disease
  as well as several immune cell markers that are indicative of health.  The core and essential protein biomarkers
  detailed here overlap with panels developed for multiplexed imaging of kidney samples using other technologies, such
  as cyTOF and cyclic multiplexed immunofluorescence.
