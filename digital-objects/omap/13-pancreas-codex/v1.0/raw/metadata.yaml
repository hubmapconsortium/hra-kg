  OMAP-13: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based
  Imaging of Human Pancreas with CODEX
description: >-
  OMAP-13 was designed for imaging of 4% PFA-fixed, cryopreserved human pancreas
  samples by CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX)
  (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00556-8). Containing 27 antibodies and
  nuclear marker DAPI, this OMAP provides spatial context for 13 anatomical
  structures and 21 cell types in the ASCT+B Pancreas table v1.2
  (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM975.BBTF.393) and shares 8 markers with OMAP-6
  (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM868.XLTM.922). It also facilitates identification
  of gamma and epsilon cells, lymphatic endothelial cells, pericytes, resident
  immune cells, neuronal structures, and some stromal cells and the
  extracellular matrix (ECM). Due to the inclusion of biomarkers PPY, GHRL,
  PTPRC (CD45), CD19, ITGAX (CD11c), AIF1 (IBA1), and CD14, this panel is
  suitable for all regions of the human pancreas (including the uncinate
  process, UBERON:0010373) from birth to adulthood and can detect inflammatory
  cells present in diabetes. Panel design and validation was performed on the
  PhenoCycler Open and Fusion systems (Akoya Biosciences). Carrier free aliquots
  for antibodies directed against targets GHRL, PPY, and LYVE1  were ordered
  directly from R&D Biosciences to allow custom conjugation; antibody metadata
  reflect the catalog versions. The GP2 antibody, which was purified and
  conjugated by Leinco Technologies, Inc., is best used in conjunction with
  another acinar cell marker. Application of this CODEX panel to early-stage T2D
  samples (Walker et al. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.16.466282)
  included cellular segmentation by DAPI using the Highplex FL module of HALO
  image analysis software (Indica Labs). Details on sample preparation and
  antibody screening can be found at
  https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.36wgq7dryvk5/v1 and a representative
  dataset is uploaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7916784. Interactive
  image browsing is available on Pancreatlas (RRID:SCR_01856).
