  OMAP-11: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based
  Imaging of Human Spleen with IBEX
description: >-
  OMAP-11 was designed for IBEX imaging of fixed frozen human spleen samples
  (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9;
  https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2018488117). The panel contains 24 primary
  antibodies, 2 secondary antibodies, and Hoechst for image alignment and
  nuclear segmentation. This OMAP provides a spatial context for the main
  anatomical structures and cell types present in the ASCT+B spleen table v1.3
  including red pulp macrophages, splenic endothelial cells, stromal cells of
  the red and white pulp, B cells, T cells, granulocytes, and platelets. This
  panel can be expanded to include more granular phenotyping of B cells (naïve,
  memory, switched), T cells (T follicular helper cells, T regulatory cells), NK
  cells, dendritic cells (cDC1, cDC2, plasmacytoid DCs), and lymphatic
  endothelial cells with the addition of appropriate markers. Several antibodies
  for CD271, a critical splenic stromal marker
  (https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12469), were tested but did not provide reliable
  labeling in the spleen for the tissue preservation method employed for this
  study (RRIDs      AB_10982271,      AB_2564818). Custom antibodies were
  purchased from BioLegend or conjugated in house using      labeling kits from
  Abcam (ab269820) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (A20182,      A20188). A
  representative dataset acquired using this OMAP can be found here:
