  OMAP-11: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Spleen with IBEX
description: |-
  OMAP-11 was designed for IBEX imaging of fixed frozen human spleen samples
  (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2018488117). The panel contains 24 primary
  antibodies, 2 secondary antibodies, and Hoechst for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. This OMAP provides a
  spatial context for the main anatomical structures and cell types present in the ASCT+B spleen table v1.3 including
  red pulp macrophages, splenic endothelial cells, stromal cells of the red and white pulp, B cells, T cells,
  granulocytes, and platelets. This panel can be expanded to include more granular phenotyping of B cells (naïve,
  memory, switched), T cells (T follicular helper cells, T regulatory cells), NK cells, dendritic cells (cDC1, cDC2,
  plasmacytoid DCs), and lymphatic endothelial cells with the addition of appropriate markers. Several antibodies for
  CD271, a critical splenic stromal marker (https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12469), were tested but did not provide reliable
  labeling in the spleen for the tissue preservation method employed for this study
  (RRIDs      AB_10982271,      AB_2564818). Custom antibodies were purchased from BioLegend or conjugated in house
  using      labeling kits from Abcam (ab269820) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (A20182,      A20188). A representative
  dataset acquired using this OMAP can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5244550.
