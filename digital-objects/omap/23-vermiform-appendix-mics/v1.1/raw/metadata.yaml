  OMAP-23: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of vermiform appendix (FFPE) with
  MICS on MACSima
description: |-
  OMAP-23 was developed for MICS (MACSima Imaging Cyclic Staining) imaging of human formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
  (FFPE) vermiform appendix tissue. Tissue fixation and antigen retrieval methods are outlined in Neil et al. (2023),
  while details of the MACSima platform and imaging approach are provided in Kinkhabwala et al. (2022). The panel
  contains 28 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI, used for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. All antibodies
  in this panel are recombinant human IgG1 with Fc receptor binding removed to prevent non-specific binding and
  eliminate the need for blocking steps. This recombinant format also allows inclusion of non-human monoclonal
  antibodies followed by species-specific fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies. The newly introduced dye VioB515 is
  used to label one marker and is removed through chemical cleavage after imaging. OMAP-23 follows the structure and
  approach of previous MICS-based OMAPs (OMAP-10 and OMAP-21) and expands upon OMAP-21 with the inclusion of markers
  targeting non-immune cell types. It provides spatial context for all anatomical structures and most cell types within
  the vermiform appendix. Reagents were sourced exclusively from Miltenyi Biotec and validated through a rigorous
  internal QC process, thus lot numbers are not included. Data analysis was performed using the MACSIQ View Analysis
  software described in Kinkhabwala et al. (2022). The software suite processes raw MACSima images, generates stitched
  views, and enables downstream analyses including segmentation, gating, normalization, dimensionality reduction (tSNE,
  UMAP), heatmaps, and clustering. This is the third OMAP designed for the MACSima platform. A representative dataset
  for OMAP-23 is available at Zenodo (Müller, Femel, and Bosio 2024).
