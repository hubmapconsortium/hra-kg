  OMAP-23: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging
  of vermiform appendix (FFPE)
  with MICS on MACSima
description: >-
  OMAP-23 was designed for MICS (MACSima imaging cyclic staining) imaging of human formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) vermiform appendix samples. Tissue fixation and antigen retrieval is described here (Neil et al. 2023). The MACSima technology is described in detail in the following publication: (Kinkhabwala et al. 2022). All antibodies in this panel are recombinant antibodies with a mutated human IgG1 constant region, removing Fc receptor binding capacity of human IgG1, eliminating the need for additional blocking steps and reducing non-specific binding. The use of human IgG1 recombinant antibodies allows for the addition of uncoupled monoclonal antibodies from other species followed by a fluorescence labelled secondary reagent specific for the species of the monoclonal antibody. The multiplex system has been described for OMAP-10 and OMAP-21. A new dye, VioB515, is used to detect one marker. The fluorescence is removed by cleavage. The panel contains 28 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. This OMAP provides a spatial context for all anatomical structures and most cell types present in the vermiform appendix. OMAP-23 follows OMAP-21 with addition of antibodies for non-immune cells. All reagents are from Miltenyi Biotec and have been rigorously tested through an internal quality control system to have minimal variation between lots. For this reason, lot information is not included in this table. Analysis was performed by an accompanied software package MACSIQ View Analysis also described in the MACSima publication (Kinkhabwala et al. 2022). The MACSima system is continuously evolving, this is the third OMAP for the MACSima system. A representative dataset created using OMAP-23 can be found here: (Muller, Femel, and Bosio 2024).
