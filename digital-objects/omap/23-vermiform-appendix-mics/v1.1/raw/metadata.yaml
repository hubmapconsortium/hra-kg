  OMAP-23: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging
  of vermiform appendix (FFPE)
  with MICS on MACSima
description: >-
  OMAP-23 was designed for MICS (MACSima imaging cyclic staining) imaging of human
  formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) vermiform appendix samples. Tissue fixation
  and antigen retrieval is described here (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.27.564191).
  The MACSima technology is described in detail in the following publication: (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05841-4).
  All antibodies in this panel are recombinant antibodies with a mutated human IgG1
  constant region, removing Fc receptor binding capacity of human IgG1, eliminating
  the need for additional blocking steps and reducing non-specific binding. The use
  of human IgG1 recombinant antibodies allows for the addition of uncoupled monoclonal
  antibodies from other species followed by a fluorescence labelled secondary reagent
  specific for the species of the monoclonal antibody. The multiplex system has been
  described for OMAP-10 and OMAP-21. A new dye, VioB515, is used to detect one marker.
  The fluorescence is removed by cleavage. The panel contains 28 antibodies and the
  nuclear marker DAPI for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. This OMAP provides
  a spatial context for all anatomical structures and most cell types present in the
  vermiform appendix. OMAP-23 follows OMAP-21 with addition of antibodies for non-immune
  cells. All reagents are from Miltenyi Biotec and have been rigorously tested through
  an internal quality control system to have minimal variation between lots. For this
  reason, lot information is not included in this table.  Analysis was performed by
  an accompanied software package MACSIQ View Analysis also described in the MACSima
  publication (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05841-4). The MACSima system is
  continuously evolving, this is the third OMAP for the MACSima system. A representative
  dataset created using OMAP-23 can be found here: https://zenodo.org/records/14008816.
