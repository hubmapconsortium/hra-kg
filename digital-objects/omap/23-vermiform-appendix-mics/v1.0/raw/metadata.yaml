  OMAP-23: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of vermiform appendix (FFPE) with
  MICS on MACSima
description: >-
  OMAP-23 was designed for MICS (MACSima imaging cyclic staining) imaging of FFPE human vermiform appendix
  sample.  Tissue fixation and antigen retrieval is described in (Spatial protein and RNA analysis on the same tissue
  section using MICS technology). The MACSima technology is described in detail in the following publication (MACSima
  imaging cyclic staining (MICS) technology reveals combinatorial target pairs for CAR T cell treatment of solid
  tumors). All, antibodies in this panel are recombinant antibodies with a mutated human IgG1 constant region, removing
  Fc receptor binding capacity of human IgG1, eliminating the need for additional blocking steps and reducing
  non-specific binding. The use of human IgG1 recombinant antibodies allows for the addition of uncoupled monoclonal
  antibodies from other species followed by a fluorescence labelled secondary reagent specific for the species of the
  monoclonal antibody. The multiplex system has been described already for OMAP-10 and OMAP-21. A new dye VioB515 is
  used for one reagents. The fluorescence is removed by cleavage. The panel contains 28 antibodies and the nuclear
  marker DAPI for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. This OMAP provides a spatial context for all anatomical
  structures and most cell types present in the vermiform appendix.  OMAP-23 follows OMAP-21, with fewer antibodies but
  adding antibodies for non-immune cells. All reagents are from Miltenyi Biotec and have been rigorously tested through
  an internal quality control  system to have minimal variation between lots. For this reason, lot information is not
  included in this table.  Analysis was performed by an accompanied software package MACSIQ View Analysis also described
  in the MACSima  publication (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05841-4). The MACSima system is continuously evolving,
   this is the third OMAP for the MACSima system.
