  OMAP-26: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based  Imaging
  of Human Kidney with IMS-CODEX
description: >-
  OMAP-26 was designed for CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) imaging of fresh frozen
  human kidney samples following imaging mass spectrometry (IMS)a as described here:
  (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.x54v9rb24v3e/v1). The panel contains 22 antibodies
  and the DAPI nuclear marker for image alignment. There is considerable marker overlap
  with other kidney OMAPs (OMAP-3 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM268.ZQNV.826), OMAP-9
  (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM697.FWDQ.488), OMAP-14 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM872.RNSG.734),
  and OMAP-20 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM624.CHLG.652)). In addition, all antibodies
  in this panel are included in OMAP-27 (Include DOI when minted), which is an expanded
  CODEX kidney panel. This OMAP captures all functional tissue units of the nephron
  as well as basement membranes, vasculature, lymphatics, stromal, and immune cell
  types (B and T cells). Innate immune cells are not captured in this panel. This
  OMAP provides a spatial context for all anatomical structures and most cell types
  present in the ASCT+B kidney table v1.6  (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM699.PTNX.744).
  This panel was developed and validated for use after matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
  mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) imaging. Additional details on sample preparation
  and antibody validation can be found at (https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/BIOMIC).
