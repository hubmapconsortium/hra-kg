  OMAP-25: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based 
  Imaging of Lung with CODEX
description: >-
  OMAP-25 was designed for Multiplexed Immunofluorescence (MxIF) imaging of human 
  FFPE lung sections utilizing Akoya Biosciences Phenocycler-Fusion platform as 
  described dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.6qpvr38dpvmk/v3.  The panel contains 
  45 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for image alignment and nuclear 
  segmentation. OMAP-25 provides spatial context for airway, vasculature, and 
  alveolar features and identifies ~40 of 72 key epithelial, endothelial, and 
  immune cell types in the ASCT+B lung table v1.2 
  (https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-releases/v1.2/docs/asct-b/lung.html). 
  OMAP-25 does not yet identify capillary type 1 and capillary type 2 endothelial 
  cells, eosinophils/basophils, fibroblast/pericytes, chondrocytes, and NK cells 
  as antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates with sufficient specificity to target 
  markers for these cell types are in development. Assay details include quenching 
  of autofluorescence and antigen retrieval in AR9 Buffer (Akoya Biosciences, 
  PN#AR9001KT) at high pressure (pressure cooker, high pressure protocol) for 
  20 minutes. Protein targets were detected with antibody barcode conjugates 
  obtained directly from Akoya Biosciences, or via custom conjugation of 
  commercially available antibodies utilizing antibody conjugation kit 
  (Akoya Biosciences, Cat# 232195).  MxIF imaging of lung sections using this OMAP
  can be found in the protocol cited above. The antibody validation protocol can
  be found here https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.rm7vzkm14vx1/v1.   
  When imaging proximal lung tissue containing large airway and vascular features, 
  antibodies directed against extracellular matrix, endothelium and vascular 
  smooth muscle should be imaged within the first five cycles to mitigate 
  potential loss of feature integrity during later cycles, whereas antibodies 
  targeting abundantly expressed pan markers identifying major cell types 
  (e.g. PanCK, ACTA2) can be imaged in later cycles.  Image analysis methods 
  including cell segmentation annotation of vascular or airway features, and 
  export of annotations and masks is described here 
  https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.6qpvr38dpvmk/v3.
