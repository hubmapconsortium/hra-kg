  OMAP-14: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based
  Imaging of Human Kidney with CyCIF
description: >-
  OMAP-14 was designed for CyCIF imaging of unfixed frozen human kidney samples  (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.81wgb1m3yvpk/v3).
  The panel contains 17  antibodies, 1 lectin, and Hoechst 33342 for image alignment
  and nuclear  segmentation. The OMAP provides a spatial context for the main anatomical  structures
  and key cell types present in the healthy human kidney. These include  markers for
  podocytes, mesangial and endothelial cells, glomerular basement  membrane, mesangial
  matrix in glomeruli,  endothelial and vascular smooth muscle  cells in the renal
  vasculature, renal tubular segments including proximal tubular  epithelial cells,
  loops of Henle (including descending thin limb and thick ascending  limb), distal
  convoluted tubules, connecting segment, cortical and medullary  collecting duct
  principal cells and intercalated cells, myofibroblasts and  peritubular extracellular
  matrix. A polyclonal antibody recognizing Zonula  occludens-1 (ZO-1), also known
  as tight junction protein-1, which detect tight  junctions, were used to segment
  podocyte plasma membranes as well as basolateral  plasma membranes in all tubular
  epithelium distal to proximal tubules. Lotus  Tetragonolobus Lectin (LTL) was used
  to visualize proximal tubular epithelial  cells, collecting duct intercalated cells,
  and inner medullary collecting duct  principal cells. LTL is visualized in the accompanying
  datasets but not included  in the OMAP because it is not an antibody. Additional
  details on sample preparation  (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bfskjncw)
  and custom conjugation of antibodies  (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.667hhhn)
  are included in these links.  Representative datasets including two tubular segment
  and one glomerular segmentation  2D CyCIF images, and one glomerular segmentation
  3D image have been uploaded here:  (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10407946; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10440320;  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10445538;  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10445538;  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10447488
