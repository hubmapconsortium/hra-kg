  OMAP-9: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Kidney with CODEX
description: |-
  OMAP-9 was designed for CODEX multiplex antibody-based imaging of fresh frozen human kidney tissue
  (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.8epv5jdbnl1b/v1). The panel contains 41 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for
  image alignment and nuclear segmentation. OMAP-9 provides a spatial context for all anatomical structures and most
  cell types present in the ASCT+B kidney table v1.1. This OMAP expands on OMAP-3 (10.48539/HBM373.TBKP.375), an 18-plex
  kidney CODEX panel, by including additional markers for granular phenotyping of key cells in the kidney such as
  structural cells (Podocalyxin, LRP2, E-cadherin, SLC12A3, Na/K ATPase and Cytokeratin 8), immune cells including T
  cells (CD3D, CD4, CD45RO, CD8, FOXP3, GATA-3), myeloid cells (CD11c, CD68, CD206, HLA-DR, Myeloperoxidase), and B
  cells (CD20). Antibodies directed against injury markers (KIM1, IGFBP7, Osteopontin, PLSCR1, VCAM1, MCP1, phosphor
  c-JUN, phosphor MLKL, Fibronectin, Collagen IV, LC3, Cystatin 3, and PROM1) allows profiling of kidney disease
  progression, prognosis, and repair. The following markers utilize different antibody clones than OMAP-3: vimentin,
  beta-catenin, and uromodulin. Mesangial cells present in the glomerulus are not targeted in the existing panel due to
  the absence of suitable antibodies compatible with the methodology. Additional details on sample preparation and CODEX
  multiplexing workflow can be found on Protocols.io (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.8epv5jdbnl1b/v1).
