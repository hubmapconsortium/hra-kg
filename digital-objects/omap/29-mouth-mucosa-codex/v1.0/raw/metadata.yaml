  OMAP-29 Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based  Imaging
  of human mouth mucosa with CODEX
description: >-
  OMAP-29 was designed for CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) imaging of human formalin
  fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) oral mucosa samples using the PhenoCycler-Fusion
  (PCF) system from Akoya Biosciences (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00556-8).
  Of note, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) instead of 10% formalin
  before paraffin embedding. Tissue slides were prepared with a two-step antigen retrieval
  process (pH 9) as described here (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.x54v9p4j1g3e/v1).
  Antigens were detected in oral mucosa tissue using primary antibodies with fluorophore-labeled
  barcodes as described in (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-49037-y). OMAP-29 contains
  40 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for image registration and nuclear segmentation.
  This OMAP provides a spatial context for most anatomical structures and cell types
  present in the ASCT+B mouth table v1, and includes core markers for epithelial cells
  (pan-cytokeratin), fibroblasts (vimentin), immune (CD45), and vascular (CD31) populations.
