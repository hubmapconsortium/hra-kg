  OMAP-4  Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based
  Imaging of Human Skin with Cell DIVE
description: >-
  OMAP-4 was designed for Cell DIVE multiplexed imaging of formalin-fixed
  paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human skin. Cell DIVE enables highly multiplexed
  single cell analysis using antibody-based imaging (Gerdes, MJ. et al, 2013) 
  The tissue slides were prepared with a two-step antigen retrieval process (pH
  6 and pH 9, as described https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bpwumpew).
  Antigens were detected using either primary antibodies with
  fluorophore-labeled secondaries or fluorescent dye conjugated antibodies
  (protocol can be found https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.b4kgqutw). The
  panel contains 18 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for image
  registration and nuclear segmentation. This OMAP provides a spatial context
  for most anatomical structures and cell types present in the [ASCT+B skin
  table, v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM423.RTRR.746).  Keratinocyte
  populations can be identified based on their spatial location, distinct
  morphology and, in the case of corneocytes, absence of nuclei.  Additionally,
  the inclusion of protein biomarkers DDB2 and p53 allow profiling of skin
  damage and aging effects. The panel was designed to get a broad representation
  of cell types found in the skin and in the future will be expanded to include
  dermal dendritic cell (DC) markers (e.g. Langerin, CD11c). This panel does not
  include markers targeting several immune cell subsets including Langerhans
  cells, mast cells, and gamma delta T cells.
