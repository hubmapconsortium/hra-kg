  OMAP-18: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging
  of human lymph node with Cell DIVE-IBEX
description: >-
  OMAP-18 was designed for Cell DIVE imaging (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1300136110)
  of human formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) lymph node samples using the IBEX
  (Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity) dye inactivation protocol. The resulting
  method, termed Cell DIVE-IBEX, allows complete signal elimination without tissue
  loss using IBEX compatible fluorophores (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9).
  The panel consists of 3 cycles of 11 primary antibodies, 4 secondary antibodies,
  a streptavidin conjugate to detect a biotinylated KI67 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific
  S21384), and nuclear label Hoechst for image alignment and nuclear segmentation.
  This OMAP provides a spatial context for 15 anatomical structures and 11 cell types
  present in the ASCT+B lymph node table, v1.1 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM573.SHCQ.259).
  OMAP-18 was designed using OMAP-1 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM458.NSWR.957) as
  a reference and therefore contains all the biomarkers included in OMAP-1. However,
  OMAP-18 is limited to essential markers for evaluating changes in lymph node architecture
  and immune cell composition arising from malignancy based on discovery studies using
  OMAP-1. For this reason, OMAP-18 does not allow granular phenotyping of fibroblastic
  reticular cells, T regulatory cells, T helper cells, blood and lymphatic endothelial
  cells, and dendritic cells but can easily be expanded in the future. Importantly,
  this panel utilizes the BCL2 clone preferred by pathologists (clone SP66), providing
  additional value for translational studies. Human FFPE samples were prepared using
  a dual antigen retrieval approach consisting of 30 minutes with Epitope Retrieval
  Solution 1 (pH 6, 100C) and then 30 minutes with Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 (pH
  9, 100C) performed on the Leica Bond. More details on the antigen retrieval protocol
  and step-by-step application of antibodies can be found on the IBEX Imaging Community
  site (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7693278). Detailed B cell follicle and cellular
  community analysis was performed as described in the accompanying manuscript (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2024.02.001).
