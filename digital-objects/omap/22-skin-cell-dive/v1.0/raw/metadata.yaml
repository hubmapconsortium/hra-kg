  Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Skin with Cell DIVE
description: >-
  OMAP-22 was designed for Cell DIVE multiplexed imaging of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human skin. Cell
  DIVE enables highly multiplexed single cell analysis using antibody-based imaging  (Gerdes, MJ. et al, 2013). The
  tissue slides were prepared with a two-step antigen retrieval process  (pH 6 and pH 9, as described in
  https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bpwumpew).  Antigens were detected using either primary antibodies with
  fluorophore-labeled secondaries or  fluorescent dye-conjugated antibodies (protocol can be found at
  https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.b4kgqutw). The panel contains 34 antibodies and the nuclear  marker DAPI for
  image registration and nuclear segmentation. This updated OMAP provides a spatial  context for most anatomical
  structures and cell types present in the [ASCT+B skin table, v1.3](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM785.XBPB.444). This
  OMAP builds from OMAP-4 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM485.ZCFD.459) and additionally includes: CD103, CD14, CD1a,
  CD207, CD34, F13A1, CDKN1A, KRT1, KRT5, KRT7, KRT10,  MLANA, PDPN, TPSAB1, and VWF. Updates from OMAP-4 include
  identification of specific keratinocyte populations.  Additionally, the panel now identifies dermal dendritic cell
  populations, mast cells, melanocytes,  and Langerhans cells. The inclusion of protein biomarkers DDB2, CDKN1A, and p53
  allow profiling of skin  damage and aging effects. Other updates include the use of commercially available conjugates
  in place of  custom conjugations when available for down-selected antibody clones. Representative datasets created
  using  this OMAP are publicly available on the HuBMAP data portal.
