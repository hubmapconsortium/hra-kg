  Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of
  Human Skin with Cell DIVE
description: >-
  OMAP-22 was designed for Cell DIVE multiplexed imaging of formalin-fixed 
  paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human skin. Cell DIVE enables highly multiplexed 
  single cell analysis using antibody-based imaging (Gerdes, MJ. et al, 2013). 
  The tissue slides were prepared with a two-step antigen retrieval process 
  (pH 6 and pH 9, as described in https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bpwumpew). 
  Antigens were detected using either primary antibodies with fluorophore-labeled 
  secondaries or fluorescent dye-conjugated antibodies (protocol can be found at 
  https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.b4kgqutw). The panel contains 34 
  antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for image registration and nuclear 
  segmentation. This updated OMAP provides a spatial context for most anatomical 
  structures and cell types present in the [ASCT+B skin table, v1.3]
  (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM785.XBPB.444). This OMAP builds from OMAP-4 
  (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM485.ZCFD.459) and additionally includes: 
  CD103, CD14, CD1a, CD207, CD34, F13A1, CDKN1A, KRT1, KRT5, KRT7, KRT10, MLANA, PDPN, 
  TPSAB1, and VWF. Updates from OMAP-4 include identification of specific keratinocyte 
  populations. Additionally, the panel now identifies dermal dendritic cell 
  populations, mast cells, melanocytes, and Langerhans cells. The inclusion of protein 
  biomarkers DDB2, CDKN1A, and p53 allow profiling of skin damage and aging effects. 
  Other updates include the use of commercially available conjugates in place of 
  custom conjugations when available for down-selected antibody clones. Representative 
  datasets created using this OMAP are publicly available on the HuBMAP data portal. 
  This revised v1.1 OMAP corrects CD3 was corrected from CD3D to CD3E.
