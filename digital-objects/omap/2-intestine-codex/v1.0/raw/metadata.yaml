  Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Intestine with CODEX
description: >-
  The OMAP Intestine panel was designed for CODEX (CO Detection by IndEXing) of fresh frozen human intestine. The panel
  contains 54 antibodies and the nuclear marker Hoechst for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. This provides
  spatial context for all anatomical structures and most cell types present in the [ASCT+B intestine
  table,v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM325.NZPB.589). In general the panel was aimed to get a broad representation of
  cell types found in the intestine spanning stromal, immune, and epithelial origins. All antibodies are custom
  conjugated in house with oligo bar codes (no lot number available).
