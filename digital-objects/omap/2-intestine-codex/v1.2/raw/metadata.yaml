  OMAP-2 Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Intestines with CODEX
description: |-
  OMAP-2 was designed for CODEX (CO Detection by IndEXing) imaging of fresh frozen human intestine
  (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00556-8, https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.202048891). The panel contains 54 antibodies
  and the nuclear marker Hoechst for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. This panel provides spatial context for
  all anatomical structures and most cell types present in the [ASCT+B intestine
  table,v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM325.NZPB.589). However, this panel does not include a marker for tuft cells, M
  cells, and subsets of major cell types that are known to be present in the intestine (e.g., neuroendocrine cell
  lineages, distinctions between alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cells, and IgA+ plasma cells). In general the panel was
  aimed to provide a broad representation of cell types found in the intestine spanning stromal, immune, and epithelial
  origins and could be used across disease settings of the intestine. Data from this panel has been analyzed as
  described previously (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.727626, https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.25.469203). All
  antibodies are custom conjugated in house with oligonucleotide barcodes (no lot number available) and run using CODEX
  imaging per previous protocols (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00556-8). Representative datasets using this OMAP
  can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.76hdr7t1p; https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gmsbcc2sq.
