  OMAP-2 Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based
  Imaging of Human Intestines with CODEX
description: >-
  OMAP-2 was designed for CODEX (CO Detection by IndEXing) imaging of fresh
  frozen human intestine (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00556-8,
  https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.202048891). The panel contains 54 antibodies and
  the nuclear marker Hoechst for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. This
  panel provides spatial context for all anatomical structures and most cell
  types present in the [ASCT+B intestine
  table,v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM325.NZPB.589). However, this panel
  does not include a marker for tuft cells, M cells, and subsets of major cell
  types that are known to be present in the intestine (e.g., neuroendocrine cell
  lineages, distinctions between alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cells, and IgA+
  plasma cells). In general the panel was aimed to provide a broad
  representation of cell types found in the intestine spanning stromal, immune,
  and epithelial origins and could be used across disease settings of the
  intestine. Data from this panel has been analyzed as described previously
  (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.727626,
  https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.25.469203). All antibodies are custom
  conjugated in house with oligonucleotide barcodes (no lot number available)
  and run using CODEX imaging per previous protocols
  (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00556-8). Representative datasets using
  this OMAP can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.76hdr7t1p;
  https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gmsbcc2sq. OMAP-2 v1.3 corrects the rrid listed
  for CDX2 to  AB_2864405 and the protein target detected by panCytokeratin
  cloneID AE-1/AE-3 Biolegend 914204 from KRT17 to all of these KRT1, KRT2,
  KRT3, KRT4, KRT5, KRT7, KRT8, KRT10, KRT14, KRT15, KRT16, KRT19.
