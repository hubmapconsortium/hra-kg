  OMAP-20: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging
  of kidney with cyclic multiplexed immunofluorescence
description: >-
  OMAP-20 was designed for cyclic multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) microscopy
  of fresh frozen human kidney samples (doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.81wgb1m3yvpk/v3).
  The panel contains 10 antibodies and the nuclear marker Hoechst for image alignment.
  This OMAP provides a spatial context for proximal tubule and glomeruli structures
  and cell types present in the ASCT+B kidney table v1.4. Functional tissue units
  other than proximal tubules, glomeruli, and vasculature are not targeted in the
  existing panel. Additional details on sample preparation and antibody validation
  can be found here (https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/BIOMIC). Representative datasets
  using this OMAP can be found here (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.21.581450). The
  antibody directed against tensin (RRID: AB_10796111) is known to perform better
  in cycle 1 than in later cycles.
