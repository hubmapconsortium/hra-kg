  OMAP-8: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based
  Imaging of Placenta with Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC)
description: >-
  OMAP-8 was designed for Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC)
  (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24584193/) of formalin-fixed
  paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human term-placenta samples. The tissue slides were
  prepared with a two-step antigen retrieval process (pH 6 and pH 9, as
  described https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bpwumpew). OMAP antibodies
  validated by immunohistochemistry and IMC were conjugated to polymers
  containing metal isotopes. Conjugated antibodies were used to stain processed
  human term-placenta tissue simultaneously. Regions of the processed tissue
  were then acquired on the imaging mass cytometer (Hyperion; Standard BioTools)
  by laser ablation and visualized. The panel contains 26 antibodies conjugated
  to unique metal isotopes and iridium marks the DNA. This OMAP provides a
  spatial context for key placenta cell types in the [ASCT+B v.1.0
  table](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM446.WGLG.755).  Single-cell RNA sequencing
  data were used to guide marker selection for multiplexed tissue imaging. For
  example, ASCL2, HLA-G, PD-L1, CD68 and LYVE1 allow functionally specialized
  cell types to be visualized and quantified in the placenta. Note that one of
  our core antibodies is to LYVE1 but, unlike in other tissues where it is used
  to mark lymphatic vasculature, here we use it to mark the macrophage of the
  placenta (Hofbauer cells) – there should be no lymphatics in the placenta.
