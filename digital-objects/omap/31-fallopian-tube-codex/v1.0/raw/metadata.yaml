  OMAP-31: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Fallopian Tube with CODEX
description: |-
  OMAP-31 was designed for imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human fallopian tube by CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00556-8). Containing 40 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI, this OMAP provides spatial context for 47 anatomical structures and 15 cell types defined in the ASCT+B Fallopian Tube v1.4 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM582.QBPD.334). It also facilitates identification of basement membrane and extracellular matrix components. Marker selection was guided by single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets as well as expert review. OMAP-31 is one of the first OMAPs for the human female reproductive system but targets cell types shared across other organs (e.g., endothelial, smooth muscle, stromal, resident immune) and shares many antibody clones with other FFPE CODEX OMAPs: OMAP-16 (lung) (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM397.PHBH.975), OMAP-32 (uterus), and OMAP-33 (ovary). This OMAP does not contain markers for Langerhans cells or plasma cells. OMAP-31 is appropriate for reproductive-age and postmenopausal samples. Panel design and validation were performed on the PhenoCycler Fusion system (Akoya Biosciences). Antibodies targeting ACTA2 (clone EPR5368), CADPS, CDKN2A, DNALI1, ENG, EPCAM, FOXJ1, FUT4, KLRC1, LGALS14, MCAM, PAX8, PGR, RUNX3, and VWF were conjugated in-house using custom conjugation kits (Akoya Biosciences). Antigen retrieval was conducted using AR9 buffer (Akoya Biosciences). A representative dataset is forthcoming on the HuBMAP portal.
