  OMAP-28: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based  Imaging of Heart with CODEX
description: |-
  OMAP-28 was developed for CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) imaging using the Akoya Biosciences PhenoCycler system on
  human formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) heart samples. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating the samples in
  Dako Target Retrieval Solution (pH 9) in a high-pressure cooker for 20 minutes. To reduce tissue autofluorescence,
  slides were treated with a solution of 4.5% hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and 20 mM sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in PBS,
  followed by photoirradiation using broad-spectrum LED light sources for two 45-minute cycles. Full protocol details
  are provided in Ahn et al. 2024. The antibody panel includes 38 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for image
  registration and cell segmentation. Cell membrane markers such as Sodium-Potassium ATPase, CD45, and vimentin, along
  with DAPI, were used for segmentation and annotation of individual cells. This OMAP provides spatial context for 26
  anatomical structures and 14 cell types as listed in the ASCT+B Heart table v1.5 (Lin, Halushka, and Boppana 2024). It
  captures all major cardiac cell types including atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, vascular and lymphatic
  endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, adipocytes,
  mesothelial cells, and Schwann cells. Markers for specialized pacemaking regions (sinoatrial and atrioventricular
  nodes) are also included. Although subtypes of immune cells and cell states are not fully represented, future updates
  may expand on these components.
