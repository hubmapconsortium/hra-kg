  OMAP-1 Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Lymph Node with IBEX
description: |-
  OMAP-1 was designed for IBEX (Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity) imaging of fixed frozen human lymph nodes
  (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2018488117). The panel contains 39
  antibodies and the nuclear marker Hoechst 33342 for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. his OMAP provides a
  spatial context for all anatomical structures and most cell types present in the [ASCT+B lymph node table,
  v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM573.SHCQ.259). Additionally, the inclusion of protein biomarkers BCL2, CD10, CD138,
  and CD44 allow profiling of lymph node disease states, e.g. follicular lymphoma and metastasis. The core and
  prioritized OMAP targets detailed here overlap (~50-85%) with panels developed for multiplexed imaging of lymphoid
  samples using other technologies and sample preparations (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31657,
  https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.202048891). This OMAP does not contain antibodies for typing pericytes, plasmacytoid
  dendritic cells, or different T helper lineages (Th1, Th2, Th17). Beyond spatial mapping of healthy human lymph nodes,
  this OMAP was used to characterize the tissue microenvironment of follicular lymphoma lymph nodes. For this study,
  object-based cellular segmentation was performed using a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach with Mask
  R-CNN architecture and ResNet-50 as a backbone. As an input three channels were used: Hoechst for nuclei, CD45 as a
  base membrane, and composite of several other membrane markers (CD138, CD163, CD94, CD69, CD8, CD4). More details and
  accompanying datasets associated with OMAP-1 can be found here (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.03.494716,
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5244550). Several antibodies required custom conjugation by commercial suppliers or
  antibody conjugation kits (e.g., AF532, Thermo A20182).
