  OMAP-7 Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based
  Imaging of Human Lung with Cell DIVE
description: >-
  OMAP-7 was designed for Cell DIVE imaging of Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded
  (FFPE) lung tissue. Cell DIVE enables highly multiplexed single cell analysis
  using antibody-based imaging (Gerdes, MJ. et al, 2013). The tissue slides were
  prepared with a two-step antigen retrieval process (pH 6 and pH 9, as
  described https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bpwumpew. Antigens were
  detected using either primary antibodies with fluorophore-labeled secondaries
  or fluorescent dye conjugated antibodies (protocol can be found
  https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.b4kgqutw. The panel contains 30
  antibodies, 4 of which are used for cell segmentation (Na/K ATPase,
  Cytokeratin, Cadherin, and S6) and the nuclear marker DAPI for image alignment
  and nuclear segmentation. This OMAP provides a spatial context for key cell
  types in the[ASCT+B lung table
  v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM323.SGDF.945).   Additionally, the inclusion
  of protein biomarkers such as AGTR1, Cathepsin L, TMPRSS2, ICAM-1, and CD55
  allow characterization of proteins relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection and
  profiling of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that may play a role in
  COVID-19 disease. The core and essential protein biomarkers detailed here
  overlap (~25%) with the panel developed for multiplexed imaging of lung
  samples established using conventional automated IHC staining for
  FFPE-material  (Dr. Christopher Werlein, an expert lung pathologist).  This
  OMAP does not contain antibodies for typing subsets of fibroblasts,
  macrophages, or endothelial cells.
