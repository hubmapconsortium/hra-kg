  OMAP-7 Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based
  Imaging of Human Lung with Cell DIVE
description: >-
  OMAP-7 was designed for Cell DIVE imaging of human formalin fixed paraffin  embedded
  (FFPE) lung tissue. Cell DIVE enables highly multiplexed single  cell analysis using
  antibody-based imaging  (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1300136110). The tissue slides
  were prepared  with a two-step antigen retrieval process (pH 6 and pH 9) as described:  https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bpwumpew.
  Antigens were detected  using either primary antibodies with fluorophore-labeled
  secondaries or  fluorescent dye conjugated antibodies. The protocol can be found
  here:  https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.b4kgqutw. The panel contains 30  antibodies,
  4 of which are used for cell segmentation (Na/K ATPase,  Cytokeratin, Cadherin,
  and S6) and the nuclear marker DAPI for image  alignment and nuclear segmentation.
  This OMAP provides a spatial context  for key cell types in the [ASCT+B lung table
  v1.1]
  (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM323.SGDF.945). Additionally, the inclusion  of protein
  biomarkers such as AGTR1, Cathepsin L, TMPRSS2, ICAM-1, and  CD55 allow characterization
  of proteins relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection  and profiling of the renin-angiotensin
  system (RAS) that may play a role  in COVID-19 disease. The core and essential protein
  biomarkers detailed  here overlap (~25%) with the panel developed for multiplexed
  imaging of  lung samples established using conventional automated IHC staining for  FFPE
  material. This OMAP does not contain antibodies for typing subsets  of fibroblasts,
  macrophages, or endothelial cells. A representative  dataset using this OMAP can
  be found here:  https://zenodo.org/record/7731162#.ZBmz2nbMIuU. This revised v1.4
  OMAP  corrects CD3 was corrected from CD3D to CD3E.
