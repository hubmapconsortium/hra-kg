  Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of
  Human Lung with Cell DIVE
description: >-
  The OMAP Lung panel was designed for Cell DIVE imaging of  Formalin-Fixed
  Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) lung tissue. The tissue slides were prepared with a
  two-step antigen retrieval process (pH 6 and pH 9, as described
  [here](dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bpwumpew). Antigens were detected
  using either primary antibodies with fluorophore-labeled secondaries or
  fluorescent dye conjugated antibodies (protocol can be found
  [here](dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.b4kgqutw).  The panel contains 31
  antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for image alignment and nuclear
  segmentation. This OMAP provides a spatial context for key lung cell types in
  the [ASCT+B lung table v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM323.SGDF.945).  
  Additionally, the inclusion of protein biomarkers such as AGTR1, Cathepsin L,
  TMPRSS2, ICAM-1, and CD55 allow characterization of proteins relevant to
  SARS-CoV-2 infection and profiling of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that
  may play a role in COVID-19 disease. The core and essential protein biomarkers
  detailed here overlap (~25%) with the panel developed for multiplexed imaging
  of lung samples established using conventional automated IHC staining for
  FFPE-material  (Dr. Christopher Werlein, an expert lung pathologist).  This
  OMAP does not contain antibodies for typing subsets of fibroblasts,
  macrophages, or endothelial cells.
