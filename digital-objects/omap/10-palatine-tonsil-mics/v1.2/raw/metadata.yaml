  OMAP-10: Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Palatine Tonsil with
  MACSima
description: >-
  OMAP-10 was designed for MICS (MACSima imaging cyclic staining) imaging  of paraformaldehyde
  (PFA)-fixed human tonsil samples. The MICS technology  is described in detail in
  the following publication  (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05841-4). Most, but
  not all, antibodies  in this panel are recombinant antibodies with a mutated human
  IgG1 constant  region. The described mutation removes the Fc receptor binding capacity
  of  human IgG1, eliminating the need for additional blocking steps and reducing  non-specific
  binding of human antibodies on human tissues. Highly  multiplexed imaging is achieved
  through cycles of immunolabeling with FITC,  PE, and APC conjugated antibodies and
  photobleaching to eliminate  fluorescence signal between imaging cycles. The panel
  contains 30 antibodies
  and the nuclear marker DAPI for image alignment and nuclear segmentation.
  This OMAP provides a spatial context for all anatomical structures and most  cell
  types present in the human palatine tonsil. OMAP-10 follows closely  OMAP-1 described
  for human lymph nodes  (https://cdn.humanatlas.io/hra-releases/v1.3/docs/omap/omap-1-human-lymph-node-ibex.html).  All
  reagents were obtained from Miltenyi Biotec and have been rigorously  tested through
  an internal quality control system to have minimal variation  between lots. For
  this reason, lot information is not included in this table.  Analysis was performed
  by an accompanied software package MACSIQ View Analysis
  also described in the MICS publication  (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05841-4).
  The result of the analysis is  included in the uploaded dataset. In brief, the software
  processes the raw  images of the MACSima run, generates stitched images, and then
  allows  downstream analysis including cell segmentation, cell gating, data normalization,  dimension
  reduction plots (tSNE, UMAP), heat maps, distance analyses and  cluster analyses,
  all of which are interactively linked together. The  MACSima system is continuously
  evolving, and this is the first OMAP for
  the MACSima system. A representative dataset created using OMAP-10 can
  be found here: (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7875937).
