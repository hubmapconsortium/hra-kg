  OMAP-27: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based  Imaging
  of Human Kidney with CODEX
description: >-
  OMAP-27 was designed for CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) imaging of fresh frozen
  human kidney samples for profiling cell types and cell states (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.buc5nsy6).
  The panel contains 46 antibodies and the DAPI nuclear marker for image alignment.
  OMAP-27 builds on OMAP-3 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM268.ZQNV.826), which was the
  first OMAP designed for studying the kidney. Additionally, it shares a significant
  number of markers (24) with OMAP-9 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM697.FWDQ.488), another
  kidney OMAP that was independently developed using the CODEX method. Furthermore,
  OMAP-27 includes all the antibodies found in OMAP-26 (DOI to be added upon minting),
  a panel specifically designed for use after imaging mass spectrometry. OMAP-27 captures
  all functional tissue units of the nephron as well as basement membranes, vasculature,
  lymphatics, the stromal compartment, adaptive immune cell types (B and T cells),
  innate immune cells, and injured cells. This OMAP provides a spatial context for
  all anatomical structures and most cell types present in the ASCT+B kidney  table
  v1.6 (https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM699.PTNX.744). Additional details on sample preparation
  and antibody validation can be found here (https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/BIOMIC).
