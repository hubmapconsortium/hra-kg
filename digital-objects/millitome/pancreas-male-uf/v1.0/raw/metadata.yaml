title: Millitome for UF Pancreas, Male
description: |-
  A millitome is a device used to hold and slice organs into a grid of equally sized tissue blocks.  It has an
  associated digital data package that includes an STL file and a spreadsheet for assigning spatial locations to tissue
  block IDs and gathering metadata with information about the size, dimensions,  donor sex, and laterality of the
  reference organ for which the millitome is fitted (https://humanatlas.io/millitome).  This millitome was designed in
  collaboration with the University of Florida for the Pancreas, Male. The extraction sites generated with a milliome
  can then be displayed in the Exploration User Interface.
