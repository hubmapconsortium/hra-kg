title: Millitome for VU Pancreas, Male
description: |-
  This millitome was designed in collaboration with Vanderbilt University for the Pancreas, Male. It defines a protocol for partitioning a human kidney organ into tissue blocks and associating those tissue blocks with a unique extraction site that is located in the HRA CCF. The [HRA AMAP](https://github.com/cns-iu/hra-amap) process was used to create the included tissue block extraction sites which approximate partitioning the [Pancreas, Male](https://purl.humanatlas.io/millitome/pancreas-male-vu) reference organ according to this millitome's protocol.
