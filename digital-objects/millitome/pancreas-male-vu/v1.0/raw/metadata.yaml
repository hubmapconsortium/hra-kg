title: Millitome for VU Pancreas, Male
description: |-
  This millitome was designed in collaboration with Vanderbilt University for the Pancreas, Male. It defines a protocol for partitioning a human kidney organ into tissue blocks and associating those tissue blocks with a unique extraction site that is located in the HRA CCF. The HRA AMAP process was used to create the included tissue block extraction sites which approximate partitioning the Pancreas, Male reference organ according to this millitome's protocol.
