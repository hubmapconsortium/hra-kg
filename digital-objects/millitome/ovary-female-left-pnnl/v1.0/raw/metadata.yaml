title: Millitome for PNNL Ovary, Female, Left
description: "A millitome is a device used to hold and slice organs into a grid of equally sized tissue blocks. It has an associated digital data package that includes an STL file and a spreadsheet for assigning spatial locations to HuBMAP IDs and gathering metadata with information about the size, dimensions, donor sex, and laterality of the reference organ for which the millitome is fitted (https://humanatlas.io/millitome). This millitome was designed in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the Ovary, Female, Left."
