title: Millitome for UPenn Fallopian Tube, Female, Left
description: |-
  This millitome was designed in collaboration with University of Pennsylvania for the Fallopian Tube, Female, Left. It defines a protocol for partitioning a human kidney organ into tissue blocks and associating those tissue blocks with a unique extraction site that is located in the HRA CCF. The [HRA AMAP](https://github.com/cns-iu/hra-amap) process was used to create the included tissue block extraction sites which approximate partitioning the [Fallopian Tube, Female, Left](https://purl.humanatlas.io/ref-organ/fallopian-tube-female-left) reference organ according to this millitome's protocol.
