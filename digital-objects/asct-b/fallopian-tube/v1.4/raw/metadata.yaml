  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Fallopian Tube
description: |-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  the nested fallopian-tube structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to
  identify cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The Fallopian Tube
  ASCT+B table includes detailed anatomical structures such as the infundibulum, ampulla, isthmus, and interstitial
  segment, along with associated cell types like ciliated epithelial cells, secretory cells, and intercalary cells. This
  comprehensive mapping supports research into reproductive biology and related medical conditions.
