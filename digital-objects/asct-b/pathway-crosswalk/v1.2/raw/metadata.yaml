  Pathway crosswalk
description: |-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are
  authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. This table provides a crosswalk between structures in the
  blood vasculature, lymph vasculature, and peripheral nervous system (PNS) ASCT+B tables. The Relationship column
  indicates the relationship between Structure1 and Structure2. In this version of the crosswalk, there are three types
  of relationships: (1) “adjacent_to” is being used here for neurovascular bundles; (2) “connects_to” indicates arterial
  vessels that connect to venous structures; and (3) “anastomosis_to” is used for anastomoses, where vessels connect to
  form loops.
