title: Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Prostate
description: |-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are
  authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The Prostate ASCT+B table represents terms related to the
  adult human prostate. These include both macroscopic and microscopic anatomical structures, major cell types, and
  protein biomarkers specific for each cell type listed. This table was generated based on published histopathologic
  nomenclature, as well as published literature on cell-type specific biomarkers. Most of the markers listed are
  observed in more than one study or orthogonally validated. Note that these are predicted markers and a single marker
  to annotate a cell type is not likely sufficient or specific. Where more refined cell types are not available in the
  ontologies, the closest general term is used. For example, there are likely multiple types of prostate stromal cells;
  however, further characterization is needed to distinguish between these cell types. Where cells of similar type occur
  in different locations, the closest and highest level of resolution available is used. For example, basal epithelial
  cells and luminal epithelial cells occur in multiple different contexts within the prostate, including the peripheral
  zone, central zone, and transition zone.
