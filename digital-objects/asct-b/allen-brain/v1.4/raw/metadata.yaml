title: Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Brain
description: >-
  This is a major update of the CT+B component of the table that extends it from
  well-curated high-resolution cell types in a single small brain region (DOI:
  10.1038/s41586-021-03465-8), to also include a first draft of cell types
  across the entire human brain (DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.12.511898).  There are no
  changes to the AS part of the table, EXCEPT adding the appropriate reference
  (DOI: 10.1002/cne.24080) in each row of the table corresponding to anatomic
  structures.  Similarly, there are no changes to rows relating to cell types
  from v1.3 of this table, EXCEPT adding “Human - Motor Cortex” in the
  “CT/1/NOTES” slot to distinguish these cell types from the newly added whole
  brain atlas types described in detail below. In addition, Kimberly Siletti has
  replaced Raymond Sanchez as an author of this table, as the updated CT
  components represent work that she led and participated in converting to this
  format.
