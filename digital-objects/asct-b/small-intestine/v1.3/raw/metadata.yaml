  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Small Intestine
description: |-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are
  authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The Small Intestine ASCT+B table represents terms related
  to the adult human small intestine. These include both macroscopic and microscopic anatomical structures, major cell
  types, and protein biomarkers specific for each cell type listed. This table was generated based on published
  histopathologic nomenclature, as well as published literature on cell-type specific biomarkers. Most of the markers
  listed are observed in more than one study or orthogonally validated. Note that these are predicted markers and a
  single marker to annotate a cell type is not likely sufficient or specific. Where more refined cell types are not
  available in the ontologies, the closest general term is used. For example, there are likely multiple types of small
  intestine stromal cells; however, further characterization is needed to distinguish between these cell types. Where
  cells of similar type occur in different locations, the closest and highest level of resolution available is used. For
  example, enterocytes occur in multiple different contexts within the small intestine, including the duodenum, jejunum,
  and ileum.
