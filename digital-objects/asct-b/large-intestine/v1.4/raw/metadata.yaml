  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Large Intestine
description: >-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  the nested large-intestine structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to
  identify cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The Large Intestine
  ASCT+B table includes detailed anatomical structures such as the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending
  colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and anal canal. Associated cell types, including various epithelial and immune cells,
  are mapped alongside relevant biomarkers. This comprehensive mapping supports research into gastrointestinal biology
  and related medical conditions.
