title: Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Uterus
description: >-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  the nested uterus structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify
  cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The Uterus ASCT+B table provides
  a comprehensive mapping of the anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers specific to the human uterus. This
  table includes detailed hierarchical relationships among uterine anatomical structures, associated cell types, and
  their corresponding biomarkers. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the cellular composition and
  molecular characteristics of the uterus within the human reference atlas. A description of this Uterus ASCT+B table
  can be found in "Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, and Biomarkers Tables Plus 3D Reference Organs in Support of a
  Human Reference Atlas" by Börner et al. 2021. The database and code used to generate the more simplified view of the
  Uterus in these ASCT+B tables may be found here:
