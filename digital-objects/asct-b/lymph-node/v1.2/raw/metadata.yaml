  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Lymph Node
description: >-
  [Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables](https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to
  capture the nested *part_of* structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to
  identify cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The lymph node ASCT+B
  tables are derived from published literature, public datasets, and domain expertise from the authors. The table
  provides a reference for a canonical human mesenteric lymph node; however, it is anticipated that these tables will be
  amended to reflect lymph nodes draining other sites of the human body and changes arising from inflammation and other
  perturbations. The gross anatomy of the lymph node was highly influenced by the following text:[(Willard-Mack
  2006)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01926230600867727). Cell types and gene biomarkers derived from sequencing studies were
  derived from the following studies:[(James et al. 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-0602-z), [(Xiang et al.
  2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2020.00052), and [(Szabo et al.
  2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12464-3). Gene biomarkers for stromal cells were obtained from an orthogonal
  study in mice (DOI: 10.1016/j.immuni.2018.04.006). Several studies employing flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry
  aided in the identification of protein biomarkers. To support granular phenotyping, we list all reported biomarkers
  including negative and differentially expressed proteins. We anticipate further refinement from multimodal studies
  that pair sequencing and imaging studies from the same human sample. In total, this table reports 34 anatomical
  structures, 45 cell types, and 223 biomarkers.
