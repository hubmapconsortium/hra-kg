  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Lymph Node
description: >-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  the nested lymph-node structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify
  cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The lymph node ASCT+B tables are
  derived from published literature, public datasets, and domain expertise from the authors. The table provides a
  reference for a canonical human mesenteric lymph node; however, it is anticipated that these tables will be amended to
  reflect lymph nodes draining other sites of the human body and changes arising from inflammation and other
  perturbations. The gross anatomy of the lymph node was highly influenced by the following text: [Willard-Mack 2006]
  (https://doi.org/10.1080/01926230600867727). Cell types and gene biomarkers derived from sequencing studies were
  derived from the following studies: [James et al. 2020] (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-0602-z), [Xiang et al.
  2020] (https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2020.00052), and [Szabo et al. 2019] (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12464-3).
  Gene biomarkers for stromal cells were obtained from an orthogonal study in mice ([Rodda et al. 2018]
  (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2018.04.006)). Several studies employing flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry
  aided in the identification of protein biomarkers. To support granular phenotyping, we list all reported biomarkers
  including negative and differentially expressed proteins. We anticipate further refinement from multimodal studies
  that pair sequencing and imaging studies from the same human sample. In total, this table reports 34 anatomical
  structures, 45 cell types, and 223
  biomarkers.
