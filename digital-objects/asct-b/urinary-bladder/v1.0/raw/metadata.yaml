  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Urinary Bladder
description: |-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  the nested urinary-bladder structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to
  identify cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The Urinary Bladder
  ASCT+B table v1.0 provides a comprehensive mapping of the anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers specific
  to the human urinary bladder. This table includes detailed hierarchical relationships among bladder anatomical
  structures, associated cell types, and their corresponding biomarkers. It serves as a valuable resource for
  understanding the cellular composition and molecular characteristics of the urinary bladder within the human reference
  atlas. A description of this Urinary Bladder ASCT+B table can be found in ""Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, and
  Biomarkers Tables Plus 3D Reference Organs in Support of a Human Reference Atlas"" by Börner et al. 2021. The database
  and code used to generate the more simplified view of the Urinary Bladder in these ASCT+B tables may be found here:
