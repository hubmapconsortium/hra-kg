title: Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Trachea
description: |-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  the nested trachea structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify
  cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The Trachea ASCT+B table v1.0
  was developed following the revisions of the Lung ASCT+B tables (v1.2–1.3), during which the Trachea and Main Bronchus
  were delineated into separate tables. This table focuses on the anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers
  specific to the human trachea. With the assistance of Joshua Fortriede, Ellen Quardokus, and Aleix Puig Barbe (EBI),
  updates were made to Uberon and the Cell Ontology, including the addition and revision of terms as necessary.
  Relationships among anatomical structures (AS-AS), anatomical structures and cell types (AS-CT), and among cell types
  (CT-CT) were corrected and verified. Gene markers were reviewed and updated based on recent single-cell RNA sequencing
  (scRNAseq) lung cell type references. A description of this Trachea ASCT+B table can be found in "Anatomical
  Structures, Cell Types, and Biomarkers Tables Plus 3D Reference Organs in Support of a Human Reference Atlas" by
  (Börner et al. 2021). The database and code used to generate the more simplified view of the Trachea in these ASCT+B
  tables may be found here
