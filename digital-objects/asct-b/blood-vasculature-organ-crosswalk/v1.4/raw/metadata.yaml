title: Blood Vasculature Organ Crosswalk
description: |-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types.  The tables are
  authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. This table provides a crosswalk from vessels in the blood
  vasculature ASCT+B table to anatomical structures in other organ ASCT+B tables.  The Relationship column indicates
  whether the vessel is “part_of”, “overlaps”, “supplies”, “drains”, “directly_supplies_drains”, “located_in”, or
  “connected_to” the anatomical structure in the BodySubPart column.  A vessel can relate to more than one anatomical
  structure; and, those relationships can occur in a particular order. For example, the vessel can pass through several
  structures along its length.  The BodyPartSequence column indicates the sequence of those structures, from the
  proximal to distal end of the vessel. The BodySubPart structure is contained within the anatomical structure listed in
  the BodyPart column.  The BodyPart is typically an organ or organ system. The FTU column indicates if the vessel is
  part of a functional tissue unit (the smallest tissue organization that performs a unique physiologic function in an
  organ).  The angiosome column indicates if the vessel is associated with an angiosome (a region of muscle, bone, and
  skin supplied by a main artery). IDs are provided for the Vessel, BodySubPart, BodySubPartSequence, BodyPart, FTU, and
  Angiosome columns to enable linkage to other datasets and ontologies.
