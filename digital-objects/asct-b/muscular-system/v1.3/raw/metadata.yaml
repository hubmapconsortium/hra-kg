  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Muscular

  [Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B)
  tables](https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture anatomical human
  body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types.
  The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. This
  ASCT+B table contains a hierarchical “partonomy” of the muscular system. The
  top level anatomical structure (“AS/1”) is “muscular system” for all
  structures. The second level (“AS/2”) divides the musculature into body
  regions. The third level (“AS/3”) lists muscle groups; and, the fourth level
  (“AS/4”) lists individual muscles. Finally, the fifth level (“AS/5”) contains
  parts of muscles. This version of the muscular system ASCT+B table only
  contains skeletal muscles. Future versions will add cardiac and smooth
  muscles. Note that the main purpose of this table is to provide a
  comprehensive list of muscles and their location in the body. Individual
  muscles might have their own ASCT+B table, which provides more detail about
  its anatomical structure, cell types and biomarkers.
