  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Mouth
description: |-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  the nested anatomical structure of human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell
  types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The Mouth ASCT+B table includes
  detailed anatomical structures such as the gingiva, tongue, buccal mucosa, hard palate, floor of mouth, and major
  salivary ducts, along with associated epithelial, stromal, vascular, immune, and neural cell types. This comprehensive
  mapping supports research into oral epithelial differentiation, mucosal immune regulation, salivary gland biology, and
  related medical conditions such as periodontitis, Sjögren’s disease, and head and neck cancer.
