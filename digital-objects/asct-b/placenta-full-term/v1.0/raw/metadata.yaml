  [Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B)
  tables](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/ccf-anatomical-structures.html)
  aim to capture the nested *part_of* structure of anatomical human body parts,
  the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables
  are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The Placenta
  ASCT+B table represents terms related to the full term human placenta. These
  include both macroscopic and microscopic anatomical structures, major cell
  types, and protein and lipid biomarkers specific for each cell type listed.
  This table was generated based on published placental histopathologic
  nomenclature, as well as published literature on cell-type specific
  biomarkers.  Most of the markers listed are observed in more than 1 study or
  orthogonally validated.  Note that these are predicted markers and a single
  marker to annotate a cell type is not likely sufficient or specific. Where
  more refined cell types are not available in the ontologies, the closest
  general term is used. For example, there are likely multiple types of
  placental stromal cells; however, further characterization is needed to
  distinguish between these cell types. Where cells of similar type occur in
  different locations, the closest and highest level of resolution available is
  used. For example, vascular endothelial cells (CL0000071) occur in multiple
  different contexts within the placenta, including the umbilical vessels,
  chorionic plate vessels, chorionic stem villous vessels and capillaries, and
  decidual vessels; similarly, vascular smooth muscle cells (CL0000359) occur in
  umbilical vessels, chorionic plate vessels, and chorionic stem villous
  vessels.
