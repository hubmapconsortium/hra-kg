title: Peripheral Nervous System Organ Crosswalk
description: >-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture
  anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are
  authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. This table provides a crosswalk from structures in the
  peripheral nervous system (PNS) ASCT+B table to anatomical structures in other organ ASCT+B tables. The Relationship
  column indicates that the nerve “innervates” the anatomical structure in the BodySubPart column.The BodySubPart
  structure is contained within the anatomical structure listed in the BodyPart column. The BodyPart is typically an
  organ or organ system. IDs are provided for the Nerve, BodySubPart, BodySubPartSequence, BodyPart, FTU, and Angiosome
  columns to enable linkage to other datasets and ontologies.Version 1.1 adds support for the pelvis, abdomen, back, and
  lower limb. NOTE: In this version 1.0 crosswalk file, there is no BodySubPartSequence, FTU or Angiosome information.
  These are placeholders for future versions of this crosswalk.
