title:  Lymph Vasculature Organ Crosswalk
description: >-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables (https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. This table provides a crosswalk from structures in the lymph vasculature ASCT+B table to anatomical structures in other organ ASCT+B tables. The Relationship column indicates that the lymphatic structure “drains” the anatomical structure in the BodySubPart column. The BodySubPart structure is contained within the anatomical structure listed in the BodyPart column. The BodyPart is typically an organ or organ system. IDs are provided for the LymphStructure, BodySubPart, BodySubPartSequence, BodyPart, FTU, and Angiosome columns to enable linkage to other datasets and ontologies. NOTE: In this version 1.0 crosswalk file, the only BodyPart and BodySubPart is the arm. There is no BodySubPartSequence, FTU or Angiosome information. These are placeholders for future versions of this crosswalk.
