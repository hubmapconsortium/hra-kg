title: Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Kidney
description: |-
  Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables aim to capture the nested kidney structure of
  anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are
  authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. The kidney ASCT+B tables are generated from a variety of
  publicly available human kidney datasets and from data generated by HuBMAP and KPMP consortia. Most of the markers
  listed are observed in more than one study or orthogonally validated. Note that these are predicted markers and a
  single marker to annotate a cell type is not likely sufficient or specific. Therefore, these are just a guide; more
  accurate annotation should be done using the entire set of enriched genes in a cluster. The cell types shown here are
  at much higher granularity, although general markers for many of the structures are also shown. There is a tradeoff in
  uncertainty of cell type annotation with higher granularity, and as spatial validation approaches become more robust,
  we will be accordingly revising these.
