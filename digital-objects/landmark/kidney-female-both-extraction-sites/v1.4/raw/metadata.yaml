title: 3D Extraction Sites for Kidney Female Both
description: >-
  Extraction sites for kidney, female (both sides) were generated to provide a simplified cross-sectional view of the
  organ. A thin slice was taken along the coronal plane to approximately divide the kidney into anterior and posterior
  halves. The kidney mesh was manually sectioned to produce a clean and narrow coronal cross-section, followed by the
  creation of a thin extrusion to represent the extraction region.
