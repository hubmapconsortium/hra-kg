title: 3D Extraction Sites for Heart Female
description: |-
  Extraction sites for heart, female were initially created in collaboration with subject matter experts (SMEs), who
  provided approximate anatomical guidance regarding typical tissue removal locations. During the early phase of
  modeling, these regions were represented using rectangular prism shapes—box-like forms customized for each site—which
  were subtracted from the heart mesh using boolean operations to simulate excision. This boolean-based approach was
  applied only to a limited number of initial examples, as it proved to be complex, time-intensive, and challenging to
  maintain through model updates. Consequently, the methodology shifted toward using visual indicators to mark
  extraction sites rather than physically altering the mesh. Some of these visual markers were placed directly by SMEs
  within Blender, while others were positioned based on SME-provided descriptions.
