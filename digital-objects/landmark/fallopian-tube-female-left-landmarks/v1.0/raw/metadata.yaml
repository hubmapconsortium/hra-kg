title: 3D Landmarks for Fallopian Tube Female Left
description: |-
  Anatomical landmarks for fallopian tube, female, left were derived from the Visible Human dataset, which provided
  partial imaging of the tubes and adjacent structures, including the ovaries. Due to inconsistencies between the
  original dataset and the modified surrounding anatomy—some of which originated from non-Visible Human sources—manual
  adjustments were made to the position and orientation of the fallopian tubes to ensure appropriate spatial integration
  within the broader anatomical model. Certain regions, particularly the fimbriae, were not distinctly visible in the
  available imaging. These segments were therefore interpolated or artistically reconstructed using anatomical
  references and inferred structural relationships.
