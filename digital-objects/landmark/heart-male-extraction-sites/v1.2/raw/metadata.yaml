title: 3D Extraction Sites for Heart Male
description: >-
  Extraction sites for heart, male were developed in collaboration with subject matter experts (SMEs), who provided
  approximate anatomical guidance on typical tissue removal locations. During the early modeling phase, these regions
  were represented using rectangular prisms—box-like shapes customized for each extraction site—and were subtracted from
  the heart mesh using boolean operations to simulate excised regions. This boolean-based method was applied to only a
  few initial examples, as the approach proved complex, time-consuming, and difficult to maintain over time.
  Consequently, the workflow transitioned to using visual markers to denote extraction areas, rather than performing
  actual mesh subtractions. Some of these visual indicators were placed directly by SMEs in Blender, while others were
  positioned based on SME-provided descriptions.
