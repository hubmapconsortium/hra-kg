title: 3D Landmarks for Large Intestine Male
description: >-
  Anatomical landmarks for large intestine, male were derived primarily from colonoscopy-based data provided by a
  subject matter expert (SME). While this dataset captured the general morphology and layout of the colon, it could not
  be directly aligned with the surrounding anatomy of the Visible Human Male dataset. The original colon from the
  Visible Human Male was unsuitable for reference due to post-mortem bloating that significantly distorted the
  anatomical structure. To address this, the colonoscopy-informed colon model was repositioned to follow an estimated
  anatomical path consistent with the presumed trajectory of the Visible Human Male colon, had post-mortem distortions
  not occurred. This approximation was informed by anatomical references and the placement of surrounding organs within
  the modified model. Consequently, the associated landmarks should be interpreted as anatomically plausible
  approximations rather than precise reconstructions.
