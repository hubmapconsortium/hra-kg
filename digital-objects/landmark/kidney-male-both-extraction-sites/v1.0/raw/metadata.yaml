title: 3D Extraction Sites for Kidney Male Both
description: |-
  Extraction sites for kidney, male (both sides) were developed to represent a simplified coronal cross-sectional view.
  A narrow slice was taken along the coronal plane, approximately dividing the organ into anterior and posterior halves.
  The mesh was manually sectioned to generate a clean and thin coronal slice, which was then extruded to indicate the
  extraction region.
