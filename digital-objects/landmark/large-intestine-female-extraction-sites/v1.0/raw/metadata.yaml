title: 3D Extraction Sites for Large Intestine Female
description: |-
  Extraction sites for large intestine, female were designed to represent substantial tissue sections removed from each
  major anatomical division of the colon.The approach focused on excising large segments from each primary region to
  reflect broad sampling across the entire
  organ.                                                                           "
