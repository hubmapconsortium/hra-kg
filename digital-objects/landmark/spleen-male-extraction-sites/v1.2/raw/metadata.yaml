title: 3D Extraction Sites for Spleen Male
description: |-
  Extraction sites for spleen, male were defined in collaboration with subject matter experts (SMEs), who provided
  approximate guidance regarding typical tissue removal locations. In the initial phase of development, these sites were
  modeled using rectangular prisms—box-like geometries customized to each extraction region. Some visual markers
  indicating these regions were placed directly by the SMEs within Blender, while others were positioned based on SME
  descriptions.
