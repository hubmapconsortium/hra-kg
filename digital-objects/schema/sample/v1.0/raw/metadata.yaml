title: HRA sample linkml schema
description: |-
  This schema defines a data model for biological sample management that tracks the hierarchical relationship between
  tissue blocks and their derived tissue sections. It captures tissue blocks as extracted pieces of tissue with spatial
  registration information, section counts, and physical measurements, while tissue sections represent thin slices
  derived from blocks with specific section numbers. The schema enables comprehensive sample provenance tracking from
  donor through tissue extraction to dataset generation, including spatial registration within reference atlases and
  detailed physical characterization of sample dimensions. This schema is described in detail in the HRA KG paper.
